    "In this lab, we'll use our knowledge of clustering to perform market segmentation on a real-world dataset!\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify and explain what Market Segmentation is, and how clustering can be used for segmentation\n",

How many Principal Components resulted in the best overall clustering performance? Why do you think this is?\n",

    "The highest ARS should be ~0.23, which suggests that the clusters are better than random chance, but far from perfect.  Overall, the quality of the clustering algorithm did a lot better than the first algorithm we ran on unscaled data. The best performance was achieved when reducing the number of Principal Components down to 4. The increase in model performance is likely due to the reduction in dimensionality. Although dropping the last 2 PCs means that we lose about 6% of our explained variance, this proved to be a net-positive trade-off for the reduction in dimensionality it provided. "
